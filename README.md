**Neeto Editor** is the library that drives the experience in all Neeto products built at [BigBinary](https://www.bigbinary.com).

## Installation

```
yarn add @bigbinary/neeto-editor
```

NeetoUI relies on [TipTap Editor](https://tiptap.dev/) for it's icons.
Install it by executing following command.

## Development

Install all the dependencies by executing following command.

```
yarn
```

Running the `yarn start` command starts a CRA app which resides in `src` folder. Use this application to test out changes. Note that nothing in the `src` folder will be bundled with NeetoUI.

## Building

Neeto Editor gets auto-published to npm on new commit to master. You can checkout the `publish` workflow in git actions to get a live update.
