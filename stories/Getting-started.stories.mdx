# Getting started

<br />
<br />

### **Installation**

<div className="sbdocs-install-code">

```
yarn add @bigbinary/neeto-editor
```

</div>

neetoEditor has few peer dependencies which are required to use neetoEditor properly. Install the peer dependencies using the below command:

<div className="sbdocs-install-code">

```
yarn add @bigbinary/neetoui @bigbinary/neeto-commons-frontend @bigbinary/neeto-icons react-toastify@8.0.2 react-router-dom@5.2.0 react-router-nav-prompt@0.4.1 formik@2.2.9 antd@4.18.7 yup@0.32.11 ramda@0.28.0 axios@0.27.2 i18next@21.7.0 react-i18next@11.16.8
```

</div>

### **Usage**

Use the `Editor` component for rendering the rich text editor.

```jsx
import { Editor } from "@bigbinary/neeto-editor";
```

Use the `EditorContent` component for displaying the rich text content.

```jsx
import { EditorContent } from "@bigbinary/neeto-editor";
```

Use the `isEditorEmpty` method to check whether the passed `htmlContent` is
considered empty by the editor.

```jsx
import { isEditorEmpty } from "@bigbinary/neeto-editor";
```

Use the `FormikEditor` component if it is used as a formik input component.

```jsx
import FormikEditor from "@bigbinary/neeto-editor";
```

### **Local development**

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/bigbinary/neeto-editor) and switch
   to the new directory.

2. Run `yarn install`. This will install all the required dependencies.

3. Run `yarn start`. This will watch for local changes as well as spin up
   Storybook.

4. Storybook should now be running and can be visited at
   [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/).

### **Building**

The neetoEditor package gets auto-published to npm for every new merge to the
main branch. You can checkout the `publish` workflow in git actions to get a
live update.
