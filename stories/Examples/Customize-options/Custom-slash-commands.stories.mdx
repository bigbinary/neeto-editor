# Custom slash commands

Neeto Editor allows users to customize their Slash Commands menu by including
their own custom commands.

Make use of `addonCommands` prop to pass an array of custom slash command menu
items. The expected array should contain items with following properties:

```json
{
  "title": "", // The name of the command that needs to be displayed. Accepts String values,
  "description": "", // The description for the command. Accepts String values.
  "optionName": "", //Unique key value for each command item. Accepts String values.
  "Icon": <> </>, // The Icon that should be shown for command. Accepts a valid React component.
  "command": ({editor, range}) => {} // A function which takes an object {editor, range} as it's argument. The function may execute any commands on the editor instance which it receives through argument.
}
```

One thing we have to keep in mind is that in order to execute any commands other
than what Neeto Editor is preconfigured to support, you need to pass those
extensions via the `extensions` prop of Neeto Editor so that editor can
recognise the command as you execute them.
