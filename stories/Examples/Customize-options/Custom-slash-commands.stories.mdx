# Custom slash commands

neetoEditor allows users to customize their Slash Commands menu by including
their own custom commands.

Make use of `addonCommands` prop to pass an array of custom slash command menu
items. The expected array should contain items with following properties:

<Table
  columns={CUSTOM_SLASH_COMMANDS_TABLE_COLUMNS}
  rows={CUSTOM_SLASH_COMMANDS_TABLE_ROWS}
/>

One thing we have to keep in mind is that in order to execute any commands other
than what neetoEditor is preconfigured to support, you need to pass those
extensions via the `extensions` prop of neetoEditor so that editor can recognise
the command as you execute them. It can be used to implement complex features
like canned response as well.
