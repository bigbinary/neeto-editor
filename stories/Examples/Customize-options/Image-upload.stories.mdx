# **Image upload**

Image upload feature can be enabled in neetoEditor by adding the `image-upload`
addon to the list of addons. All the images are uploaded using a pre-signed URL
from the backend.

<Canvas>
  <Editor addons={["image-upload"]} />
</Canvas>

> Similar to image upload, video upload can be enabled by adding the
> `video-upload` addon to the list of addons.

### **Integration with Rails**

Rails provides a `ActiveStorage::DirectUploadsController` to handle direct
upload to the storage service. You will need to override the `create` action of
the controller and return the `blob_url` of the uploaded file. Pass the route to
the `create` action as the `directUploadEndpoint` in the `config` prop. For the below example,
`directUploadEndpoint` is "/api/direct_uploads".

```rb
class Api::DirectUploadsController < ActiveStorage::DirectUploadsController
  def create
    blob = ActiveStorage::Blob.create_before_direct_upload!(**blob_args)
    blob_url = rails_blob_url(blob)
    render json: direct_upload_json(blob).merge(blob_url:)
  end
end
```

### **Integration with other backends**

NeetoEditor sends a total of two requests to upload the image to the storage
service (say AWS S3).

1. A `GET` request is sent to the `uploadEndpoint` endpoint with the following
   payload:

```json
"blob":  {
  "filename": "image.png",
  "content_type": "image/png",
  "byte_size": 452011,
  "checksum": "<checksum>"
}
```

The response must contain the the `blob_url` (URL to the uploaded image) and a
`direct_upload` key containing the pre-signed URL ad headers for the second
request.

```json
{
  "blob_url": "<image_url>",
  "direct_upload": {
    "url": "<pre-signed_url>",
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "image/png"
    }
  }
}
```

2. A `PUT` request is sent to the received pre-signed URL from the editor with
   the image as the payload. Once done, the image will be available for
   insertion.

### **Unsplash image picker**

neetoEditor provides an option to add images from `unsplash.com` using an
Unsplash image picker. Pass the Unsplash access key to the editor via the
`editorSecrets` prop and pass the addon `image-picker-unsplash` to enable it.

<Canvas>
  <Editor
    addons={["image-upload", "image-upload-unsplash"]}
    editorSecrets={{ unsplash: "<unsplash-secret-key>" }}
    defaults={[]}
  />
</Canvas>

### **Upload configuration**

The default configuration for uploads is:

```json
{
  directUploadEndpoint: "/api/direct_uploads"
  restrictions: {
    maxNumberOfFiles: 5,
    maxFileSize: globalProps.endUserUploadedFileSizeLimitInMb,
    allowedFileTypes: [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif"]],
  },
}
```
