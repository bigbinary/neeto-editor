# Table

The "table" add-on in neetoEditor allows you to display data in a tabular format.
You have a menu that includes an icon to insert a table. When a table is in focus (i.e., the user has selected a table), an additional settings icon appears in the menu. Clicking on this settings icon reveals a dropdown menu with various table commands that the user can apply to the selected table.

The insert table icon in the menu allows the user to quickly add a new table to the document. It is automatically given default dimensions (e.g., 3 columns by 3 rows) which can be customized. A default table can also be added to the document by typing the following command in the editor: `Mod-alt-t`.

The settings icon that appears when a table is in focus allows the user to access a variety of table commands. When the user selects a command from the dropdown menu, the table is updated to reflect the chosen action.
