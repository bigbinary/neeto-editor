# **FormikEditor Props**

#### **shouldFormikEditorUpdate**

The `shouldUpdate` prop in the `neeto-editor`, specifically for FormikEditor, is used to determine whether the field should re-render when its props change. It takes a function as its value, and this function is called with two arguments:

- `nextProps`: The next set of props that the field is going to receive.
- `prevProps`: The previous set of props that the field had.

The function you provide to `shouldUpdate` should return `true` if you want the field to re-render based on a comparison of the specific props you are interested in. For instance, you can use this prop to make the field re-render when the `variables` or `mentions` props change.

**Example:**

```javascript
<FormikEditor
  // Other props...
  shouldUpdate={(nextProps, prevProps) => {
    // Compare specific props and return true if re-render is needed.
    return nextProps.variables !== prevProps.variables || nextProps.mentions !== prevProps.mentions;
  }}
/>
```
Please note that, as of now, the `shouldUpdate` prop specifically considers changes in the `mentions` and `variables` props for determining whether the field should re-render. Other props will not be available for comparison through this prop.

#### **Note**

> The empty value or initialValue should should always be `<p></p>`.
