# Integrated to neetoEditor

File attachment feature can be enabled in neetoEditor by adding the
`attachments` addon to the list of addons. All the files are uploaded using a
pre-signed URL from the backend. This addon also enables the drag and drop
feature to upload files.

<Canvas>
  <Editor addons={["attachments"]} />
</Canvas>

> The file attachment feature uses a procedure similar to image upload feature.
