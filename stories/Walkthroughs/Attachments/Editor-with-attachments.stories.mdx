# Integrated to neetoEditor

File attachment feature can be enabled in neetoEditor by adding the `attachments`
addon to the list of addons. All the files are uploaded using a pre-signed URL
from the backend.
This addon also enables the drag and drop feature to upload files.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Integrated to neetoEditor">
    <Editor addons={["attachments"]} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

> The file attachment feature uses a procedure similar to image upload feature.
